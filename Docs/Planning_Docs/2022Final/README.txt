[NOTE FOR THE FUTURE] Now that those are done, lets add in original ideas

Let's add in new holidays

LibreFlock Brazil (Angry Birds Rio, but stripped of media from the Rio franchise)
LibreFlock Space (includes compatiblity mode for AB Star Wars, but does not use any Star Wars branding for legal reasons)
LibreFlock 2 (nah, not yet)

Implement childhood idea, explicitly list it as so:

Destroyed items go to a "heaven" region

(my childhood idea never counted the casualties for some reason)

With community modding, LibreFlock can be a full open source reimplementation of Angry Birds (texture and text swapping)

LibreFlock 2022.12.13

Level editor (separate)

Unlock items as you go? This setting can be toggled

true: You have to play levels to unlock items in the level editor
false: All items are unlocked in the level editor from the start

Level editor (integrated)

Edit existing levels within the game, make multiple copies of each level
Modified copies don't count towards existing game progress, if you try and modify a level to cheat (or modify it at all) playing that modification won't allow you to progress to the next level, but you can always go back to the original level format (without losing your modifications) beat the level, and progress onward

Skin engine:

Skin store, change game skin, skins can be easily enabled/disabled, and require just placing/renoving a file into the games /skin/ folder to install/uninstall
If the game starts with no skins in the folder, it will load with an error, but will still be playable, as the game will have a built-in fallback skin (known as GEOFLOCK16.gd) that is embedded into the source code. It consists of simple geometric shapes in 16 different colors. It is not the recommended way to play, but it is possible (and it isn't NOT recommended at the same time either, if you like it this way, feel free to play with it this way :) )
Default skins
Cannot be redistributed with the problem legally at the moment: RovioAngryBirds.skin.zip

Cow revenge mode

Write game in: GDScript

Libf: cow revenge mode
Libf: more achievements
Libf: more DIR struct

Level file headers and data structure definition
